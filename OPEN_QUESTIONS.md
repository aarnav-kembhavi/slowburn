# Open questions (team decisions)

## Data
- **NapierOne access**: registration / download pending. Once in `data/napierone/`, confirm the
  directory layout (benign originals vs per-family encrypted copies, filename pairing) so the
  loader config can be written.
- **NapierOne splicing**: real encrypted files are fully encrypted by each family's own scheme.
  We plan to splice their bytes into our damage masks (same offset). Confirm this is acceptable
  to describe as "real ciphertext bytes, synthetic placement".
- **RanSAP**: which traces to use for churn/attack-timing realism checks.

## Modelling
- **Dwell / discovery numbers**: fill `configs/discovery.yaml` context sources (Mandiant,
  Sophos) with verified values and years. They only motivate the sweep range.
- **Chunking**: fixed-size 4 KiB chunks for now. Content-defined chunking (as real dedup
  backup tools use) would change which chunks count as "changed" after an edit. Decide
  whether this matters for the paper.
- **Stripe length** for the striped damage model: 16 bytes by default. Real intermittent
  encryptors vary; consider sweeping it.
- **Calibration prior**: isotonic probabilities are calibrated on a class-balanced calibration
  set (i.e. under a 50/50 prior). Conformal p-values are prior-free. Decide which the paper
  reports as "the score".

## Baselines
- **AMOEBA paper**: PDF to be added to `docs/`; check the reimplementation details against it.

## Paper
- Venue / formatting template and page limit.
